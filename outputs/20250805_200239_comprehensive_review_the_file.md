🔍 [CODE REVIEWER]
It seems that there were syntax errors in the provided code, which prevented us from conducting a
    comprehensive review. Hereâs a consolidated report on how to address this:  ### Summary of
    Findings 1. **Syntax Errors**: There is a critical syntax error in the code that needs fixing
    before any further analysis can be conducted. This error seems to pertain to improper logic or
    structure within the code.  2. **Security Concerns**: Without correct syntax, security analysis
    cannot be fully performed. Ensuring the code is syntactically correct will be the first step
    before a detailed security review can be done.  3. **Quality and Performance Analysis**: The
    syntax error also prevented any meaningful insights into code quality and performance. These
    analyses are vital to optimizing and securing your code, but require error-free syntax.  ###
    Recommendations and Next Steps - **Correct Syntax Errors**: Review the code for common mistakes
    like incorrect imports, misplaced colons, mismatched brackets, or other typical syntax issues.
    - **Local Testing**: Run the code in a local development environment with a linter to detect and
    correct syntax errors before re-submitting the code for review.  - **Re-evaluate After Fixes**:
    Once the syntax errors are resolved, the code should be re-evaluated to complete the security,
    quality, performance, and QA assessments.  Please proceed with correcting the syntax errors, and
    feel free to reach out with the revised code for an in-depth analysis.

🔍 [PERFORMANCE SPECIALIST]
Based on the responses from the specialists, the primary concern is the syntax errors present in the
    code. These errors have prevented a thorough analysis across all specified roles: quality,
    security, performance, and QA. Here is a summary of the findings and the recommended steps to
    address these issues:  ### Findings: 1. **Syntax Errors**: All analyses were hindered due to
    syntax errors detected in the code. Errors were likely found in import statements or during
    function definitions. 2. **Security and Quality Assessment**: Both security and quality
    assessments could not proceed due to these errors. 3. **Performance Analysis**: Complexity
    metrics could not be evaluated due to the same syntax issues. 4. **QA & Test Generation**: The
    syntax errors prevented automated test generation.  ### Recommendations: - **Correct Syntax
    Issues**:   - Review the code for misplaced punctuation, incorrect function definitions, or any
    missing elements (e.g., imports, variables).   - Utilize linting tools or an IDE with syntax
    highlighting to easily spot errors.    - **Test Locally**:   - Run the code in a local Python
    environment to identify and correct any errors.   - **Resubmit for Analysis**:   - Once fixed,
    resubmit the code for a comprehensive review to ensure that all aspects are addressed, including
    security, quality, performance, and QA testing.  ### Next Steps: 1. **Local Debugging**: Use a
    Python IDE or a code editor to debug and test the code locally. Fix all syntax issues
    highlighted by the tools. 2. **Linter Setup**: Consider using a Python linter such as `pylint`
    to catch errors in real-time. 3. **Submit Corrected Code**: Once syntax errors are resolved,
    resubmit the corrected code.  Feel free to provide the corrected version of the code for a full
    analysis once these syntax issues have been addressed.

🔍 [SECURITY SPECIALIST]
Based on the responses above, it is essential to correct the syntax errors in your code before
    proceeding with a comprehensive analysis. Hereâs a collaborative action plan with best
    practices to follow:  ### Immediate Actions: 1. **Identify and Correct Syntax Errors**:    -
    Double-check and correct any issues related to code structure, such as missing brackets, colons,
    incorrect indentations, and misplaced imports.    - Make sure all functions are correctly
    defined and any external modules or packages are properly imported.  2. **Use Developer Tools**:
    - Use an IDE or code editor with built-in linting to catch syntax errors automatically.    - Run
    the code in an interactive Python environment to help pinpoint the exact line of error.  3.
    **Validate Locally**:    - Execute the full code locally to ensure there are no remaining syntax
    errors and that the code behaves as expected.  4. **Prepare for Re-analysis**:    - Once the
    syntax errors have been fixed, resubmit the code for a detailed scan by security tools and
    further analysis on all aspects like quality, security, and performance.  ### Future Best
    Practices: - **Version Control**: Employ a version control system such as Git to track changes
    and experiment with adjustments safely. - **Code Review**: Encourage code peer review to catch
    errors early and benefit from diverse oversight. - **Continuous Integration**: Set up continuous
    integration to automatically run tests on new changes to proactively catch these issues.  Once
    the above steps are completed and syntax errors are resolved, feel free to resubmit the
    corrected code for analysis across all facets including security, quality, performance, and QA
    testing. This will ensure you receive a comprehensive and valuable feedback report.
